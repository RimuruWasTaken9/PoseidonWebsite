Things to Note about Website:
- Contains three HTML files, one CSS file, one JS file, and images for each of the pages.
- Uses bootstrap elements for some layouts and masonry for one layout on the homepage.
- The website is completely frontend for convenience to the user, and no backend is required.
- Since there are less than 150 lines of javascript, Jquery was not used to decrease the loadtimes.



Feedback/Contributions:
- Solutions to decrease file sizes and loadtimes are always welcome.
- Satisfying alternative to the masonry layout on the homepage.
- Eventual removal of all bootstrap elements to decrease file size.
- Reports of bugs or issues
- Any criticism or ideas for new pages or sections.

IMPORTANT:
I am working on another repository for this website that utilizes Jquery, EJS, mySQL, Node & Express, and adds new features. 
Since this project introduces a lot of new elements, I thought it would be better to make a new repo instead of a new branch.
