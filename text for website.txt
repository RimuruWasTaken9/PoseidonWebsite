ABOUT US:

Over 100 years ago, Demetrius Anagnostou began baking delicious treats in his small shop on the island of Corfu. His dreams led him to New York, where he settled on the west side of Manhattan, and earned a living doing what he knew best - baking.

The Poseidon Bakery, founded in 1923, began supplying New York with authentic treats from ancient Greece. In 1923 Michael Anagnostous, the eldest son, arrived from Athens, and worked side by side with his father developing the secret recipes for the delicious sweets and savories. Together, Michael and Menina Anagnostou worked long and hard over the decades to establish to the outstanding reputation of the Poseidon Bakery on Ninth Avenue.

Today, the Poseidon Bakery is one of New York's authentic family run businesses. It's the one place to find light, flaky phyllo still made by hand, and Baklava that customers travel miles for. Generations have passed, and the neighborhood has changed, but the delicacies at the Poseidon have remained the same.

Call us or stop by. We're open Tuesday through Saturday, 10am to 6pm.

In 1923, Demetrios Anagnostou arrived in New York City and began baking the delicious treats he made in his small shop on the islnaf of Corfu. Together with his eldest son Michael, the Poseidon Bakery was founded in the heart of Hell's Kitchen.

For decades, Michael and his beloved wife Menina worked side-by-side making some of the most amazing, authentic treats for New York City's finest restaurants and discerning customers.

Their secret recipes were handed-down to their sons John and Anthony, who continued the tradition and expanded their outstanding reputation.

Today, the Poseidon Bakery tradition continues as one of New York City's authentic, family-run businesses, owned and operated by Lili Fable and her son Paul, the grandson of Michael.

For over a century, Poseidon has been the single source for authentic, hand-made Greek treats. The Poseidon Bakery is one of the only places in the country that still patiently makes phyllo by hand, supplying world-renowned chefs, global food connoisseurs and NY's finest restaurants.

While our recipes are secret - our delicious sweets and savories provide a glimpse of the old-school preparation, outstanding ingredients and love passed through many generations.
